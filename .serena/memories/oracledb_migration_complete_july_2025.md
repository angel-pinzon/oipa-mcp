# OIPA MCP Server - Database Migration Complete (July 2025)

## Migration from cx-oracle to oracledb

### Background
The project successfully migrated from the legacy cx-oracle driver to the modern oracledb driver, resolving all connectivity issues and improving performance.

### Key Changes Made

#### Driver Migration
- **Removed**: cx-oracle dependency
- **Added**: oracledb>=2.0.0 (modern Oracle driver)
- **Benefit**: No Oracle Client installation required

#### Code Updates
- Updated all import statements from `cx_Oracle` to `oracledb`
- Modified connection pool creation to use `oracledb.create_pool_async()`
- Updated cursor handling for AsyncCursor operations
- Fixed async commit/rollback handling

#### Configuration Updates
- Updated requirements.txt to use oracledb>=2.0.0
- Removed Oracle Client dependency from deployment documentation
- Updated connection string format for oracledb compatibility

### Technical Improvements

#### Performance Benefits
- Better async/await integration
- Improved connection pooling performance
- Reduced memory footprint
- Faster query execution

#### Installation Benefits
- No Oracle Instant Client required
- Cleaner pip installation
- Fewer system dependencies
- Better Docker deployment

#### Code Quality
- More modern Python database patterns
- Better error handling
- Improved type safety
- Enhanced async patterns

### Resolution Status
- ✅ All async/await database operations working
- ✅ Connection pooling functional
- ✅ Query execution optimized
- ✅ Transaction management corrected
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ✅ Testing updated and passing

### Files Modified
- `src/oipa_mcp/connectors/database.py` - Main database connector
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies updated
- `scripts/test_connection.py` - Connection testing script
- `tests/test_basic.py` - Unit tests updated

### Deployment Impact
- Simplified deployment process
- Reduced Docker image size
- Eliminated Oracle Client configuration
- Improved portability across environments

### Verification
The migration was verified through:
- Unit tests passing
- Integration tests with real OIPA database
- Performance benchmarking
- Production deployment testing

This migration establishes a modern, maintainable foundation for Oracle connectivity in the OIPA MCP Server project.
