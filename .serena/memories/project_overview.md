# OIPA MCP Server - Project Overview (Updated)

## Project Purpose
MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Oracle OIPA (Insurance Policy Administration) integration. Provides intelligent tools for policy management, client operations, transaction execution, and analytics through natural language interface.

## Current Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Complete MCP server infrastructure
- ✅ Oracle database connectivity with connection pooling
- ✅ 3 functional tools for Fase 1
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and testing
- ✅ Production-ready architecture

## Main Components
1. **MCP Server Core** (`src/oipa_mcp/server.py`): Complete MCP protocol implementation
2. **Configuration System** (`src/oipa_mcp/config.py`): Environment-based config with validation
3. **Database Connector** (`src/oipa_mcp/connectors/database.py`): Oracle async connector with pooling
4. **Tools Framework** (`src/oipa_mcp/tools/`): Extensible tool architecture with base classes
5. **Testing & Scripts** (`tests/`, `scripts/`): Unit tests and utility scripts

## Implemented Tools (Phase 1)
1. **oipa_search_policies**: Intelligent policy search by number, client name, tax ID
2. **oipa_get_policy_details**: Comprehensive policy information with client and plan data
3. **oipa_policy_counts_by_status**: Dashboard-style analytics with status distribution

## Integration Methods
- **Direct Database Access**: Fast Oracle queries for read operations
- **FileReceived Web Service**: Structure ready for transaction execution
- **Push Framework**: Architecture prepared for async messaging

## Business Value Delivered
- Natural language policy search
- Real-time analytics dashboards
- Comprehensive policy views
- Foundation for advanced automation

## Ready for Expansion
- Client management tools (Phase 2)
- Transaction execution via FileReceived
- Advanced analytics and ML insights
- Workflow automation capabilities
