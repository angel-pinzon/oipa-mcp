# Enhanced Policy Search - Database Names for Status and States (January 2025)

## Enhancement Implemented
Successfully enhanced the OIPA MCP Server to include human-readable names for policy status and issue states by joining with the AsCode lookup table.

## Changes Made

### Database Layer Enhancements (`src/oipa_mcp/connectors/database.py`)

#### Updated `search_policies` Query
- Added LEFT JOIN with AsCode table for status descriptions
- Now returns `status_name` along with `status_code`
- CodeName = 'AsCodeStatus' for status lookups

#### Updated `get_policy_details` Query  
- Added LEFT JOIN with AsCode table for both status and state descriptions
- Now returns:
  - `status_name` and `status_description` for policy status
  - `issue_state_name` and `issue_state_description` for issue state
- Separate joins for 'AsCodeStatus' and 'AsCodeState'

#### Updated `count_policies_by_status` Query
- Added LEFT JOIN with AsCode table for status descriptions
- Now returns `status_name` along with counts and percentages

### Tool Layer Enhancements (`src/oipa_mcp/tools/policy_tools.py`)

#### SearchPoliciesQuality Tool
- Enhanced to use database-provided `status_name` when available
- Falls back to formatted status code if database name not available
- Improved user experience with human-readable status names

#### GetPolicyDetailsTotal Tool
- Enhanced to include both status and state names in response
- Added separate fields for codes, names, and descriptions
- Comprehensive policy information now includes:
  - `status`: Human-readable status name
  - `status_code`: Original status code
  - `status_description`: Long description from database
  - `issue_state`: Human-readable state name
  - `issue_state_code`: Original state code  
  - `issue_state_description`: Long description from database

#### PolicyCountsByStatusSmall Tool
- Enhanced to use database-provided status names
- More accurate status reporting with actual OIPA configured names
- Falls back to formatted codes for consistency

## OIPA Table Structure Used

### AsCode Table Structure
- **CodeName**: Category identifier ('AsCodeStatus', 'AsCodeState')
- **CodeValue**: Actual code used in other tables
- **ShortDescription**: Brief human-readable name
- **LongDescription**: Detailed description

### Common Status Codes (AsCodeStatus)
- '01': Active/En Vigor
- '08': Pending/Pendiente  
- '99': Cancelled/Cancelada
- '13': Suspended/Suspendida

### State Codes (AsCodeState)
- Various state/province codes with full names
- Example: '06': 'Quebec', '32': 'New York'

## Benefits Delivered

### Enhanced User Experience
- Status names now display as "Active" instead of "01"
- State information shows "Quebec" instead of "06"
- More intuitive and user-friendly policy information

### Improved Data Accuracy
- Uses actual OIPA-configured descriptions
- Consistent with OIPA user interface
- Eliminates hardcoded mappings that may become outdated

### Backward Compatibility
- Still returns original codes for integration purposes
- Graceful fallback when database descriptions not available
- No breaking changes to existing tool interfaces

## Testing Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive test script: `scripts/test_enhanced_policy_search.py`
- Tests AsCode table structure and data availability
- Validates all three enhanced queries work correctly
- Provides debugging output for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements Ready
- Framework established for other lookup tables (roles, plan types, etc.)
- Pattern can be extended to client information, addresses, etc.
- Ready for internationalization with multiple language support

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience while maintaining technical robustness and backward compatibility.
